# Exploring Urban Morphology globally
## The code from the project for the assessment of CASA0007: Quantitative 
Methods.

This exploratory project uses the package momepy to download data on urban 
morphometrics from cities globally and does some analysis on 
classification of cities into continents, and k-means clustering.
